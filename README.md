Bash script for converting FLAC files into mp3 using FFmpeg ([ffmpeg.org](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html)) in a folder named "flac_files" 

Please note ffmpeg is a command line tool. If you're unfamilar with that (as I was originally), the installation may be a little unfamilar and you need to add the route to the environment variables. There are tutorials on youtube.

This script needs to be in the flac_files folder.

Please note the meta data from the flac WILL NOT BE included.
You will need to manually re-add that yourself or use a CUE file.
